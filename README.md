# User CSS
This repo contains random bits of user CSS that I've made for various sites. These are pure CSS mods that can be applied with a browser plugin.

## Usage

I personally use [Stylus for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and [Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), but any plugin that allows you to load custom CSS on a site should work fine.

## Maintenance

I make no guarantees that I'll keep this stuff working and up to date, but bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

## License

All code in this repo is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for full terms.

Please DO NOT submit these styles to websites like [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/). If I want them on there, I'll put them there myself.
