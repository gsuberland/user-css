# Pouet

[Pouet](https://www.pouet.net/) is a demoscene site. Some would argue that it's basically *the* demoscene site, although [there](https://demozoo.org/) [are](https://www.scene.org/) [others](http://www.bitfellas.org/).

## Synthwave Theme

I'm a big fan of the synthwave aesthetic, so I made this theme. It's roughly based off of the [SynthWave '84 VS Code theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode), which is frickin' incredible. You can install `pouet-synthwave.css` using a browser extension for custom CSS (e.g. Stylus).

## Forum-style Comments

I personally don't like the way that Pouet renders comment threads with the name, time, etc. below each comment. It's also a fixed width design that wastes a fair bit of space on 4K monitors. This CSS patch shifts those details to the right of each comment, similarly to how many forums display things. It also enables a more fluid width layout for use on high-resolution monitors. You can install `pouet-forum-comments.css` using a browser extension for custom CSS (e.g. Stylus).
